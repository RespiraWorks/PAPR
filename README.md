# Unnamed PAPR Project

This is a low-cost 3D-printable PAPR project by Edwin Chiu (github: inceptionev)

Most of the work is being done in the sandbox folder now.  Once things are tested and working, files and instructions will move into the releases folder.

I am making this for myself, and for my loved ones who are medical workers and essential workers.  They wear masks all day to keep us safe.

I am also working on a ventilator project which can be found at https://respira.works and https://github.com/RespiraWorks/Ventilator

This is the beginning of the project, with much more information to come later.

It uses commonly-available 6000-series or 7093 bayonet filter cartridges, which have many options in N95, P95, and P100 types.
